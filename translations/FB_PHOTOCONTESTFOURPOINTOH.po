# Strings marked by msgid are original English strings.
# To replace them with strings in your preferred language,
# just fill msgstr field with your translation, e.g.:
# msgid "Hello"
# msgstr "Hola"
#
# Strings wrapped by double curly braces are variables,
# which should be kept in their original formats, e.g.:
# msgid "Hello, {{this.name}}"
# msgstr "Hola, {{this.name}}"
#
# Placeholder like %{name}s shouldn't be translated, and
# it needs to be placed in the correct position in your
# translation. For example:
# msgid "Welcome, %{name}s"
# msgstr "Bienvenida, %{name}s"
